prediction.py: Analyzing effect of the words on prediction
• Listed the 10 words whose presence most strongly predicts that the article belongs to specific category for each five categories.
• Listed the 10 words whose absence most strongly predicts that the article belongs to specific category for each five categories. <br/>
